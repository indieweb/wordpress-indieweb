IndieWeb for WordPress!

== Description ==

The IndieWeb Plugin for Wordpress helps you establish your IndieWeb identity by extending the user profile to provide [rel-me](https://indieweb.org/rel-me) and
[h-card](https://indieweb.org/h-card) fields and optionally adding widgets to display this. It also includes a bundled installer for a core set of IndieWeb-related plugins. It's
meant to be a one-stop shop to help WordPress users quickly and easily join the growing [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) movement (see below).

Some of these plugins allow you to:

* send and receive comments, likes, reposts, and other kinds of post responses using your own site
* allow comments on others' sites to show up as comments on your posts
* help make IndieWeb comments and mentions look better on your site
* allow support for webmentions
* provide basic support for [Microformats 2](http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2)
* add location support to your posts
* more easily syndicate your content to other sites to take advantage of network effects and other communities while still owning all of your original content
* link to syndicated versions of a post so that comments on your content in silos like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+ can come back to your original post as comments there
* set up a MicroPub Server to use other posting interfaces. (You could potentially use services like Instagram, Foursquare, and others to post to your WordPress site.)
* Use your site to log into other services with [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/indieauth).

= The IndieWeb =

**The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’ that allows you to be the hub of your own web presence.** It's been written about in [Wired](http://www.wired.com/2013/08/indie-web/), [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-new-editors-of-the-internet/378983/), [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/04/25/indiewebcamps_create_tools_for_a_new_internet.html), and [Gigaom](https://gigaom.com/2014/09/03/dont-like-facebook-owning-and-controlling-your-content-use-tools-that-support-the-open-web/) amongst others.

= The IndieWeb, like WordPress, feels that your content is yours =

When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users’ data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.

= The IndieWeb is here to help you be better connected =

Your articles and status messages can be syndicated to all services, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone in your social network/social graph. Even replies and likes on other services can come back to your site so they’re all in one place.

Interested in connecting your WordPress site to the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/)? Let us help you get started.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get Started? =

IndieWeb for WordPress includes a plugin installer program. A Getting Started Guide can be found under IndieWeb.

= Where can I find help? Can I contribute? =

A group of web developers (including those knowledgeable about WordPress, among many other web technologies) can be found discussing and working on IndieWeb related technologies in the wiki at [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org) or in the #IndieWeb [IRC on Freenode](https://indieweb.org/IRC). WordPress specific portions of the IndieWeb camp can be found at [WordPress](https://indieweb.org/wordpress), [Getting Started on WordPress](https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started_on_WordPress), [Examples](https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Examples), and other [plugins](https://indieweb.org/WordPress/Plugins).

If you need additional assistance, feel free to reach out to any of the [WordPress Outreach Club](https://indieweb.org/WordPress_Outreach_Club) members via the website, our individual websites, or our social media presences -- we're happy to help!

= Why IndieWeb? =

Find more information and details for the motivations for joining the IndieWeb at https://indieweb.org/Why

= What about plugin XYZ? =

If you think we missed a plugin reference, please file an issue on [Github](https://github.com/indieweb/wordpress-indieweb/issues).

= What plugins are included in this package? Can I install them separately? =

One could certainly download, install, and activate some or all of these plugins separately, picking and choosing features as needed, but it is much quicker and easier to utilize the interface provided by this IndieWeb plugin to install and activate them.

* Webmention (Required) - allows you to send and receive by adding webmention support to WordPress. Mentions show up as comments on your site.
* Semantic Linkbacks (Required) - turns webmentions into richer responses, such as replies/likes/RSVP etc.
* Post Kinds - Allows you to reply/like/RSVP etc to another site from your own, by adding support for kinds of posts to WordPress.
* Syndication Links - Automatically adds syndication links from a supported syndication plugin or by manual entry in the post editor. Support for NextScripts: Social Networks Auto-Poster (aka SNAP), the Medium plugin, and a few others.
* MicroPub - A MicroPub Server for publishing posts using third-party Micropub clients
* IndieAuth - Adds an IndieAuth endpoint to WordPress. Alternatively, if you do not want to enable this, you can use a third-party endpoint to login to the WordPress backend via IndieAuth.
* Bridgy - User Interface for the Brid.gy Web Service
* Microformats 2 - provides basic mf2 support for any WordPress theme that does not support mf2 already. Note, due to inability to access every element via a filter or action, an [IndieWeb theme](http://indieweb.org/WordPress/Themes) is recommended.
* Simple Location - adds basic location and weather support to WordPress posts

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `indieweb`-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress
3. ...and that's it :)
4. Seriously though, this plugin includes a number of other configurable files as well as services, which need to be set up/configured individually. A good resource for details on setting them up quickly can be found at <a href="https://indieweb.org/Getting_Started_on_WordPress">IndieWeb: Getting Started on WordPress</a>. We also recommend viewing the instruction pages of the individual sub-plugins themselves.
